Varnish Module (VMOD) for executing long-running shell commands with support of two-way communication and command interface based on one-line request and one-line response, similar to [redirectors and rewrite scripts](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Redirectors) available in Squid Cache. Although this is not production-ready, it is useful for internal services and provisioning of features you are going to move to VMOD later, as allows you to use **any programming language or sh scripting** and expose it's features to VCL.

## Synopsis

```vcl
import shell;

new OBJECT = shell.exec(STRING cmd)
STRING <obj>.cmd(STRING value)
BOOL   <obj>.write(STRING value)
STRING <obj>.read()
INT    <obj>.pid()
```

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaszlach/libvmod-shell.git libvmod-shell/
cd libvmod-shell/
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

## Examples

```vcl
vcl 4.0;
import shell;

sub vcl_init {
    new php = shell.exec("php /srv/eval.php");
    new bc  = shell.exec("bc -q");
}

sub vcl_deliver {
    set resp.http.php-result-1 = php.cmd("'PHP '.phpversion()"); // PHP 5.6.33-0+deb8u1
    set resp.http.php-result-2 = php.cmd("gethostbyaddr('" + client.ip + "')"); // localhost
    set resp.http.bc-result    = bc.cmd("(2*3+4*5-6*7)/8"); // -2
}
```

PHP script under `/srv/eval.php` reads single line with command from VCL and executes `eval` on it, returning the result, making sure `eval` output is a single line as well:

```php
<?php

while ($line = fgets(STDIN)) {
    $line = rtrim($line);
    eval("\$result = ($line);");
    // make sure $result is a single line
    $result = str_replace("\n", " ", $result);
    echo "$result\n";
    fflush(STDOUT);
}
```

> **Notice**: Mind that `read()` and `cmd()` calls are blocking, if your script takes long time to respond it may lower down request handling overall performance. 

As `shell.exec()` runs all commands through `sh -c`, you can use all it's power as well:

```vcl
vcl 4.0;
import shell;

sub vcl_init {
    new md5 = shell.exec("while read -r line; do echo -n $line | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1; done");
}

sub vcl_recv {
    set req.http.X-Local-Secret = md5.cmd("secr3t" + client.ip + req.http.Host);
    if (req.http.X-Local-Secret != req.http.X-Secret) {
        return synth(403, "Forbidden");
    }
}
```

Above VCL adds authorization based on `X-Secret` request headers, which is compared to in-VCL generated MD5 hash combined from a secret value, client IP and `Host` header.

vmod-shell can also be used as a simple logging mechanism:

```vcl
vcl 4.0;
import shell;

sub vcl_init {
    new cat = shell.exec("cat > /tmp/vcl.log");
}

sub vcl_deliver {
    if (resp.status != 200) {
        cat.write("[" + now + "][HTTP " + resp.status + "] " + req.http.Host + req.url);
    }
}
```

Above VCL logs all non-200 responses to `/tmp/vcl.log`:
